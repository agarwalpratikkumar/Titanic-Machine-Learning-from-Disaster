# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This Project is building a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived in the Titanic incident or not.

Motivation:
The motivation for this project was to get first hand experience in analysing any dataset. And how to apply various machine learning
algorithms to make predictions.

The complete project is done in R language. The dataset is available on Kaggel. Help from Kernels has been taken for the successfull
completion of this project. 
As this was my first project in R, I have tried to add sufficient comments explaining the meaning of each and every line in the project.
